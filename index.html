            <p>Making a top 10 list for films is challenging. Making a top 5 list of movies is slightly easier, albeit still quite difficult. It is hard to narrow down what parameters to use for such a broad category of art, and so I will attempt to use two parameters that I believe make up a substantial amount of the impact of a movie: The cast, and the directors. At number five, I have Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy shines in his role as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and his impeccable style of raw emotion and candor make it one of his best performances. The supporting cast is stellar, with the likes of Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon. I feel that the casting for this movie was perfect, including the costume and makeup design, as well as the actors themselves who played each role to perfection. Christopher Nolan's sharp and eccentric directing style showcased the movie perfectly, and the subject being portrayed was masterfully executed. </p>

            <p>Coming in at number four is The Shawshank Redemption. This was a movie that I feel was Tim Robbin's best role, where he showcases his emotional range and his superb acting prowess. Morgan Freeman excels in his supporting role, helping to bring the story together and serve as the glue for the narrative. Frank Darabont created an instant classic, with this being his first feature film. His amazing storytelling style and the directorial techniques he implemented helped to enhance the story in many different ways. </p>
