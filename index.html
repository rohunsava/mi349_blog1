            <h3>My Top 5 Films of All Time</h3>

            <p>Making a top 10 list for films is challenging. Making a top 5 list of movies is slightly easier, albeit still quite difficult. It is hard to narrow down what parameters to use for such a broad category of art, and so I will attempt to use two parameters that I believe make up a substantial amount of the impact of a movie: The cast, and the directors. At number five, I have Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy shines in his role as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and his impeccable style of raw emotion and candor make it one of his best performances. The supporting cast is stellar, with the likes of Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon. Christopher Nolan's sharp and eccentric directing style showcased the movie perfectly, and the subject being portrayed was masterfully executed.</p>

            <p>Coming in at number four is The Shawshank Redemption. This was a movie that I feel was Tim Robbin's best role, where he showcases his emotional range and his superb acting prowess. Morgan Freeman excels in his supporting role, helping to bring the story together and serve as the glue for the narrative. Frank Darabont created an instant classic, with this being his first feature film. His amazing storytelling style and the directorial techniques he implemented helped to enhance the story in many different ways. Additionally, the story itself was written and executed perfectly, utilizing many writing techniques and great foreshadowing elements. </p>

            <p>Number three is The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan's Batman has long been one of my favorite trilogies, but Heath Ledger's Joker takes the cake in terms of the three Batman movies. He puts on the performance of a lifetime in his portrayal of the Joker, and Christian Bale encompasses both Bruce Wayne and Batman in every aspect imaginable. The costume and set design were amazing, and the storytelling set in Gotham City makes it a very entertaining and telling story. Christopher Nolan's utilization of darker themes and a poignant soundtrack raises the bar for superhero movies to come.</p>

            <p>My second favorite film of all time is The Social Network. Jesse Eisenberg portays a young Mark Zuckerberg effortlessly, matching his quirky demeanor and steady sense of arrogance. It chronicles the rise (and steady falls) of Facebook, spinning a story of betrayal and success. The supporting cast of Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, and Armie Hammer makes this movie a great watch, and the direction of David Fincher makes it easy to rewatch. The movie as a whole is sharp, unflinching, and distinctly unique.</p>

            <p>My all time favorite movie: Scarface. Al Pacino's masterful portryal of a drug lord who rose from the slums is a timeless classic. It is the quintessential "rags to riches" movie, and one that can never be retold in any caliber. Brian De Palma's fantastic storytelling is the main character in this movie, and his directorial prowess is easily seen in this film. There are so many iconic scenes from this movie that can be quoted and shown, which is what makes it a cult classic.</p>
