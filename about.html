            <h3>Rohun Savanur</h3>
            <p> Hi! I'm Rohun, I'm a junior studying Information Science at Michigan State University, and I love films. I've always been fascinated with cinema, and the art of making a film. Ever since I saw ET: The Extra Terrestrial, I was hooked. I also try to do UX work on the side, as I am currently taking coursework related to it. So far, I have taken: </p>

               <p>1. MI 349</p>
               <p>2. MI 220</p> 
               <p>3. MI 304</p> 
               <p>4. MI 401</p>

            <p> I'm in the process of completing more coursework that should be done by senior year. </p>
