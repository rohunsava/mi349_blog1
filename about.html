            <h3>Rohun Savanur</h3>
            <p> Hi! I'm Rohun, I'm a junior studying Information Science at Michigan State University, and I love films. I've always been fascinated with cinema, and the art of making a film. Ever since I saw ET: The Extra Terrestrial, I was hooked. I also try to do UX work on the side, as I am currently taking coursework related to it.</p>
